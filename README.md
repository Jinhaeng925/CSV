# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

In the DataViz.py file, I incorporated all the concepts we learned related to Data Viz to:
  1. read from two different files
  2. enumerate the header row to retrieve index values of the various variables (date, tmax, tmin, etc.)
  3. lists were created to store the values for each of the files
  4. try-except-else was used for error checking, because there may be missing dates
  5. matplotlib was explored to create a basic figure with two subplots, with titles, etc.
